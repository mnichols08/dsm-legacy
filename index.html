            <h3>A Groundbreaking Alliance</h3>
            <p>Diamond Star Motors (DSM) represented a pioneering cross-continental partnership between America's Chrysler Corporation and Japan's Mitsubishi Motors. The name ingeniously combined elements from both companies' logos: Mitsubishi's three diamonds and Chrysler's pentastar.</p>
            <p>Formed in 1985, this joint venture established its manufacturing home in Normal, Illinois, with a state-of-the-art facility spanning nearly 2 million square feet. The plant incorporated cutting-edge automation with approximately 1,000 robots working alongside its human workforce.</p>
            <p>What made DSM remarkable was its blend of Japanese engineering precision with American automotive design sensibilities. This cultural fusion resulted in vehicles that captured the imagination of enthusiasts and everyday drivers alike, creating a legacy that continues to influence automotive culture today.</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem; line-height: 1.7;">The partnership between Chrysler and Mitsubishi allowed for significant technology sharing that benefited both companies. Mitsubishi's advanced engineering expertise in areas like turbocharging, all-wheel drive systems, and performance tuning helped Chrysler compete in segments where they previously lacked competitive products.</p>

                    <p>Before Diamond Star Motors, Chrysler imported Mitsubishi vehicles and rebadged them for the American market. These "captive imports" helped Chrysler fill gaps in their lineup, particularly in the compact and subcompact segments, while giving Mitsubishi access to the American market through Chrysler's established dealer network.</p>

                    <p>Vehicles like the Starion/Conquest demonstrated Mitsubishi's commitment to performance engineering. Their turbocharged engines, advanced suspensions, and motorsport success created a performance legacy that directly influenced the development of DSM's iconic Eclipse, Talon, and Laser models.</p>

<dsm-timeline id="timeline" title="THE HISTORY" subtitle="Key moments in the Diamond Star Motors journey">
    <dsm-timeline-item year="1970" title="The Beginning">
        <p>The origins of Diamond Star Motors began when Chrysler acquired a 15% stake in Mitsubishi Motors. This initial partnership allowed Chrysler to distribute Mitsubishis as captive imports under Chrysler, Dodge, and Plymouth brands.</p>
    </dsm-timeline-item>
    <dsm-timeline-item year="1982" title="Growing Partnership">
        <p>Chrysler was now importing 110,000 Mitsubishis annually. The compact cars were helping Chrysler meet consumer demand for smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, filling a critical gap in their product lineup.</p>
    </dsm-timeline-item>
    <dsm-timeline-item year="1985" title="Official Formation">
        <p>Chrysler Corporation and Mitsubishi Motors Corporation officially established Diamond Star Motors as a 50-50 joint venture. The partnership was designed to circumvent import quotas and combine resources for mutual benefit.</p>
    </dsm-timeline-item>
    <dsm-timeline-item year="1986" title="Breaking Ground">
        <p>Construction began on a $650 million manufacturing facility in Normal, Illinois. The 1.9 million square foot plant was designed with an annual production capacity of 240,000 vehicles, showcasing both companies' commitment to the venture.</p>
    </dsm-timeline-item>
    <dsm-timeline-item year="1988" title="Plant Completion">
        <p>The Diamond Star Motors manufacturing facility was completed in Normal, Illinois. The highly automated plant featured approximately 1,000 robots working alongside its human workforce.</p>
    </dsm-timeline-item>
    <dsm-timeline-item year="1989" title="Production Begins">
        <p>The first "DSM triplets" rolled off the assembly line: the Mitsubishi Eclipse, Plymouth Laser, and Eagle Talon. These sporty 2+2 coupes shared the same platform with different styling cues and would soon develop a cult following.</p>
    </dsm-timeline-item>
    <dsm-timeline-item year="1991" title="Ownership Change">
        <p>Facing financial difficulties, Chrysler sold its 50% stake in the joint venture to Mitsubishi. However, the production of Chrysler vehicles continued on a contractual basis, maintaining the partnership in practice.</p>
    </dsm-timeline-item>
    <dsm-timeline-item year="1995" title="New Identity">
        <p>Diamond Star Motors was officially renamed Mitsubishi Motors Manufacturing America (MMMA), reflecting Mitsubishi's full ownership of the facility. Despite the name change, many enthusiasts continued to use the DSM designation.</p>
    </dsm-timeline-item>
    <dsm-timeline-item year="1998" title="Eagle Brand Discontinued">
        <p>Production of the Eagle Talon ended as Chrysler discontinued the Eagle brand entirely. The DSM trilogy was reduced to a duo with only the Mitsubishi Eclipse continuing production for future generations.</p>
    </dsm-timeline-item>
    <dsm-timeline-item year="2015" title="End of an Era">
        <p>Mitsubishi announced the closure of the plant in Normal, Illinois. Despite efforts to find a buyer to preserve jobs, the facility that had been the birthplace of the DSM legends would close its doors after nearly three decades of operation.</p>

                <p style="line-height: 1.7;">The AWD system on GSX, TSi AWD, and RS Turbo AWD models featured a viscous coupling center differential that sent 50% of power to the rear wheels in normal conditions, with the ability to transfer more power to either axle as needed for optimal traction in various conditions.</p>

                <p style="line-height: 1.7;">The turbocharged AWD variants could accelerate from 0-60 mph in approximately 6.4 seconds - impressive performance for early 1990s sports cars in their price range. Their combination of speed, handling, and all-weather capability made them formidable competitors against more expensive sports cars.</p>

            <h3>An Enthusiast Phenomenon</h3>
            <p>Though the Diamond Star Motors partnership was relatively short-lived in automotive terms, its impact on car culture has been profound and enduring. The term "DSM" evolved beyond the company name to become shorthand among automotive enthusiasts for the Eclipse, Talon, and Laser models.</p>
            <p>These vehicles developed a devoted following for their tunability and performance potential. The 4G63 turbocharged engine found in top-trim models proved capable of handling significantly more power than stock, making DSM vehicles favorites in the aftermarket tuning community.</p>
            <p>Racing success further cemented the DSM legacy, with modified Eclipses, Talons, and Lasers competing successfully in various motorsport disciplines from drag racing to hill climbs. In 2004 and 2005, Greg Collier won the NASA Super Unlimited class national title in a Plymouth Laser RS Turbo, beating purpose-built Ferrari and Porsche race cars.</p>
            <p>Today, well-preserved examples of first-generation DSM vehicles are increasingly sought after by collectors, recognizing their significance in automotive history as pioneers of accessible performance and emblems of Japanese-American automotive collaboration.</p>
