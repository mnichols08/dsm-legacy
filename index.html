            <h3>A Groundbreaking Alliance</h3>
            <p>Diamond Star Motors (DSM) represented a pioneering cross-continental partnership between America's Chrysler Corporation and Japan's Mitsubishi Motors. The name ingeniously combined elements from both companies' logos: Mitsubishi's three diamonds and Chrysler's pentastar.</p>
            <p>Formed in 1985, this joint venture established its manufacturing home in Normal, Illinois, with a state-of-the-art facility spanning nearly 2 million square feet. The plant incorporated cutting-edge automation with approximately 1,000 robots working alongside its human workforce.</p>
            <p>What made DSM remarkable was its blend of Japanese engineering precision with American automotive design sensibilities. This cultural fusion resulted in vehicles that captured the imagination of enthusiasts and everyday drivers alike, creating a legacy that continues to influence automotive culture today.</p>

<dsm-timeline id="timeline" title="THE HISTORY" subtitle="Key moments in the Diamond Star Motors journey">
    <dsm-timeline-item year="1970" title="The Beginning">
        <p>The origins of Diamond Star Motors began when Chrysler acquired a 15% stake in Mitsubishi Motors. This initial partnership allowed Chrysler to distribute Mitsubishis as captive imports under Chrysler, Dodge, and Plymouth brands.</p>
    </dsm-timeline-item>
    <dsm-timeline-item year="1982" title="Growing Partnership">
        <p>Chrysler was now importing 110,000 Mitsubishis annually. The compact cars were helping Chrysler meet consumer demand for smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, filling a critical gap in their product lineup.</p>
    </dsm-timeline-item>
    <dsm-timeline-item year="1985" title="Official Formation">
        <p>Chrysler Corporation and Mitsubishi Motors Corporation officially established Diamond Star Motors as a 50-50 joint venture. The partnership was designed to circumvent import quotas and combine resources for mutual benefit.</p>
    </dsm-timeline-item>
    <dsm-timeline-item year="1986" title="Breaking Ground">
        <p>Construction began on a $650 million manufacturing facility in Normal, Illinois. The 1.9 million square foot plant was designed with an annual production capacity of 240,000 vehicles, showcasing both companies' commitment to the venture.</p>
    </dsm-timeline-item>
    <dsm-timeline-item year="1988" title="Plant Completion">
        <p>The Diamond Star Motors manufacturing facility was completed in Normal, Illinois. The highly automated plant featured approximately 1,000 robots working alongside its human workforce.</p>
    </dsm-timeline-item>
    <dsm-timeline-item year="1989" title="Production Begins">
        <p>The first "DSM triplets" rolled off the assembly line: the Mitsubishi Eclipse, Plymouth Laser, and Eagle Talon. These sporty 2+2 coupes shared the same platform with different styling cues and would soon develop a cult following.</p>
    </dsm-timeline-item>
    <dsm-timeline-item year="1991" title="Ownership Change">
        <p>Facing financial difficulties, Chrysler sold its 50% stake in the joint venture to Mitsubishi. However, the production of Chrysler vehicles continued on a contractual basis, maintaining the partnership in practice.</p>
    </dsm-timeline-item>
    <dsm-timeline-item year="1995" title="New Identity">
        <p>Diamond Star Motors was officially renamed Mitsubishi Motors Manufacturing America (MMMA), reflecting Mitsubishi's full ownership of the facility. Despite the name change, many enthusiasts continued to use the DSM designation.</p>
    </dsm-timeline-item>
    <dsm-timeline-item year="1998" title="Eagle Brand Discontinued">
        <p>Production of the Eagle Talon ended as Chrysler discontinued the Eagle brand entirely. The DSM trilogy was reduced to a duo with only the Mitsubishi Eclipse continuing production for future generations.</p>
    </dsm-timeline-item>
    <dsm-timeline-item year="2015" title="End of an Era">
        <p>Mitsubishi announced the closure of the plant in Normal, Illinois. Despite efforts to find a buyer to preserve jobs, the facility that had been the birthplace of the DSM legends would close its doors after nearly three decades of operation.</p>

                        <h3>An Enthusiast Phenomenon</h3>
                        <p>Though the Diamond Star Motors partnership was relatively short-lived in automotive terms, its impact on car culture has been profound and enduring. The term "DSM" evolved beyond the company name to become shorthand among automotive enthusiasts for the Eclipse, Talon, and Laser models.</p>
                        <p>These vehicles developed a devoted following for their tunability and performance potential. The 4G63 turbocharged engine found in top-trim models proved capable of handling significantly more power than stock, making DSM vehicles favorites in the aftermarket tuning community.</p>
                        <p>Racing success further cemented the DSM legacy, with modified Eclipses, Talons, and Lasers competing successfully in various motorsport disciplines from drag racing to hill climbs. In 2004 and 2005, Greg Collier won the NASA Super Unlimited class national title in a Plymouth Laser RS Turbo, beating purpose-built Ferrari and Porsche race cars.</p>
                        <p>Today, well-preserved examples of first-generation DSM vehicles are increasingly sought after by collectors, recognizing their significance in automotive history as pioneers of accessible performance and emblems of Japanese-American automotive collaboration.</p>

                        <h3>Origins & Formation</h3>
                        <p>Diamond Star Motors began in 1970 when Chrysler purchased a 15% stake in Mitsubishi Motors as part of MMC's strategy to expand through foreign partnerships. The name "Diamond Star Motors" derived from their respective logos: Mitsubishi's three diamonds and Chrysler's pentastar.</p>
                        <p>By 1982, Chrysler was importing about 110,000 Mitsubishi vehicles annually. However, voluntary import quotas limited the number of Japanese cars entering the US market. To circumvent these limitations, the two companies officially formed Diamond Star Motors in October 1985.</p>

                        <h3>Manufacturing Excellence</h3>
                        <p>The companies broke ground on a 1.9 million square foot production facility in Normal, Illinois in April 1986. The plant was completed in March 1988 with an annual capacity of 240,000 vehicles. Initially, Diamond Star Motors was a 50-50 joint venture between Chrysler and Mitsubishi.</p>
                        <p>The plant employed cutting-edge manufacturing techniques and automation, with approximately 1,000 robots working alongside human workers, making it one of the most advanced automotive plants in North America at the time.</p>

                        <p>The first models produced at the DSM facility included the Mitsubishi Eclipse, Plymouth Laser, and Eagle Talon - all 2+2 sports cars built on a newly co-designed platform. These three vehicles were mechanically identical with only cosmetic differences between them.</p>
                        <p>Later production included the Mitsubishi Mirage/Dodge/Plymouth Colt/Eagle Summit sedans, the Mitsubishi Galant, the Dodge Avenger Coupe/Chrysler Sebring Coupe, and the Dodge Stratus Coupe, showing the versatility of the joint venture's design capabilities.</p>

                        <h3>End of an Era</h3>
                        <p>In 1991, Mitsubishi purchased Chrysler's stake in the joint venture. From that point forward, the manufacture of Chrysler vehicles was on a contractual basis only. Chrysler completely sold its equity stake to Mitsubishi in 1993, and on July 1, 1995, Diamond Star Motors was renamed Mitsubishi Motors Manufacturing America (MMMA).</p>
                        <p>Production at the plant ended on November 30, 2015. The facility was ultimately sold to electric vehicle startup Rivian in 2017 for $16 million, marking a transition from traditional performance cars to the future of electric mobility.</p>
